        <h1>The Project </h1>
		<p>CYBEX is a cybersecurity automation system meant to increase the speed and accuracy of responding to cybersecurity incidents in real time. CYBEX will be designed to import and analyze log files from different appliances and applications in real time to identify potential attacks or breaches. If a compromise is found, CYBEX will generate a potential solution to that problem and push it out to all relevant devices connected to the CYBEX system.</p>
		<p>Throughout this process, the privacy of organizations will be preserved. CYBEX will sanitize log files to remove any sensitive or identifying information. When a new rule or solution is sent out to members, no identifying information will be provided about what triggered the event. No actual logs will be saved on the CYBEX system and members of CYBEX will not be able to know any other members of the system.</p>
		<p>We will demonstrate the functionality of CYBEX in a sandbox environment simulating a small network. There will be an attacking device, a security device, some assets, and the CYBEX system in the environment. CYBEX should be able identify certain attacks from the attacking device and send rule changes to the security device on the network in order to stop them.</p>
