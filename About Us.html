        <h1>The Team </h1>
		<h4>Kathleen Lowe</h4>
		<p>Kathleen has over a decade of industry experience, including process, reliability, and quality engineering. In 2016, she completed the SANS Instituteâ€™s week-long course, SEC 301 Introduction to Information Security, which covered fundamental security principles, cryptography, network security, host security, and protecting assets. During August of 2017, she was a member of the CyberStart program during which she received instruction in a variety of penetration techniques such as webpage vulnerability exploitation via SQL injection, as well as the creation of python scripts for exploiting password and communication protocol vulnerabilities. She plans to contribute to all aspects of the project, with particular emphasis on validation.</p>
		<h4>Timothy Muller</h4>
		<p>Tim is currently a senior in college pursuing his CSE degree. He is especially interested in cybersecurity and has been an active participant in the Nevada Cyber Club. He has participated in numerous cybersecurity competitions, including placing 4th out of 155th in the NCL team-based competition. He has also attended numerous coding competitions during his college career. Tim plans to contribute to every part of the project, with an emphasis on exploitation detection/prevention.</p>
		<h4>Alexander Parr</h4>
		<p>Alexander has extensive coding experience from 7+ years of programming contests. He was also one of the earliest members of the Nevada Cyber Club and has captained their cybersecurity contest team for the past 1.5 years. He is fairly familiar with a lot of programming and cybersecurity techniques but has never worked on a large-scale team project. Alexander will be very involved with the algorithmic coding work for the project but plans to still be involved with all steps.</p>
